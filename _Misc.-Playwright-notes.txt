"We recommend setting workers to "1" in CI environments 
to prioritize stability and reproducibility. 
Running tests sequentially ensures each test gets the full system resources, 
avoiding potential conflicts. 
However, if you have a powerful self-hosted CI system, 
you may enable parallel tests. 
For wider parallelization, 
consider sharding - distributing tests across multiple CI jobs."
