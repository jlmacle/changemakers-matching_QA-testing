Cucumber with Cypress: 
    - Parentheses seem to be an issue 
when processing the step labels
    - Using tabs, instead of spaces, after Given, When,... got the steps to be ignored.

Cucumber with Playwright: as of 03/07/25, 
I couldn't find mainstream information concerning
using successfully baseURL when @cucumber/cucumber and features used.

https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel 

"Playwright Test runs tests in parallel. 
In order to achieve that, 
it runs several worker processes 
that run at the same time. 
By default, 
test files are run in parallel. 
Tests in a single file are run in order, 
in the same worker process.

You can configure tests 
using test.describe.configure 
to run tests in a single file in parallel.

You can configure entire project 
to have all tests in all files 
to run in parallel 
using testProject.fullyParallel 
or testConfig.fullyParallel.

To disable parallelism 
limit the number of workers to one."

"Ever had a Playwright test pass locally but fail on CI? ðŸ˜¤

Itâ€™s one of the most frustrating issues in test automation. But before you start guessing what went wrong, you can try to reproduce CI failures locally!

âœ… Run your test 100 times with --repeat-each=100 to expose flakiness
âœ… Max out your CPU cores using --workers=10 to stress test your system
âœ… Use -x to stop on the first failure and save time

By running these checks locally, you can catch hidden issues before they break your CI pipeline. ðŸ’ª"
