Parentheses seem to be an issue 
when processing the step labels

https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel 
"Playwright Test runs tests in parallel. 
In order to achieve that, 
it runs several worker processes 
that run at the same time. 
By default, 
test files are run in parallel. 
Tests in a single file are run in order, 
in the same worker process.

You can configure tests 
using test.describe.configure 
to run tests in a single file in parallel.

You can configure entire project 
to have all tests in all files 
to run in parallel 
using testProject.fullyParallel 
or testConfig.fullyParallel.

To disable parallelism 
limit the number of workers to one."
